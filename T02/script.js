//Create an array of twenty integer random numbers from 1 to 10, using some loops.
var arr = [];
//TODO fill your array

console.log(arr);

//TODO create your loop to output numbers from the array

// Create a program that will output every even **value** from this array (use `for ... in`).
// Additionally, the program must stop after **value** of 1 was found (using break).
// The program must also bypass every **index** divided by 5 (using continue).
